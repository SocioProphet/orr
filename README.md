# ORR - Ontology Registry and Repository

**under construction**

For developers, this is a parent repo intended to facilitate the integration of 
the backend and frontend components of the ORR system:  
[orr-ont](https://github.com/mmisw/orr-ont) 
and 
[orr-portal](https://github.com/mmisw/orr-portal).

The creation of the artifacts for a full installation is currently done 
via some manual steps directly on those two components.
